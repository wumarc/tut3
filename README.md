one of you in class asked in the last tutorial why the style of the button on the XML layout preview does not show up the same on the emulator, that is because the preview can appear differently depending on the device (there are many different screen sizes and screen resolutions). You can learn more [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35017420/why-does-this-layout-work-in-preview-but-not-on-my-device).
